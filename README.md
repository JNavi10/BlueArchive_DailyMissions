# Introduction

Daily missions in Blue Archive are painfully repetitive, and take a lot of time to complete.
They reduce the fun aspect of the game, making it more of a chore then enjoyment, hence the name: homework.

This project aims to reduce the chore-like nature of daily missions by automating many of them.
